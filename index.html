<h1>Dom Marshall</h1>

<p>Programming is a passion for me and has been a key part of who I am since I started
  in February 2023. I pride myself on attention to detail and am not someone who cuts
  corners. I am hard-working, focused and want those around me to thrive. Working in the
  music industry has taught me a lot about being in a team. It has also provided a lot of
  opportunities to study tech from an audio perspective. Getting things to work has always
  been an obsession for me, from recording cassette tapes to modular synths to mixing with
  digital audio workstations.</p>

<p>I now believe the future of our economy is in tech and have shifted my focus over to
  software development. For the first few months of my study I focused on Python, building
  numerous apps and games, then shifted my attention towards web development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS
  and Django. Since then I have branched out to learning Java, Kotlin, AWS, React
  and basic data science. I also built a website for my music portfolio using some Google Cloud
  and PHP.</p>

<p>Besides the To Do list (JavaScript) and two sample sites (HTML) clickable at the top of this page, here
  are some other examples of my work mentioned in this bio:</p>
